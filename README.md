# Tutorial 2

This tutorial consists of two small walkthroughs:

1. working with regression models in R
2. programming in the tidyverse. 

The regression models in R file will show how to fit and work with model object in R. The programming with the tidyverse will introduce the concept of tidy evaluation. 

You can work with either the .rmd file to work with the code, or read through the .html file. Both will come in handy when doing your first assignment.
